<h3>Provides shade and privacy.</h3>
<p>One of the main benefits of garden furniture with a parasol is that it provides shade and privacy. This is especially important if you live in a hot climate or if you have a yard that is exposed to the sun for most of the day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection from the sun.</strong><br /><p>A parasol can provide much-needed protection from the sun's UV rays. This is especially important if you have young children or if you have health conditions that make you sensitive to the sun.</p></li>
<li><strong>Cooler temperatures.</strong><br /><p>A parasol can also help to lower the temperature in your outdoor space. This is because the parasol blocks the sun's rays from directly reaching the furniture and the ground below. As a result, you can enjoy a more comfortable outdoor environment, even on the hottest days.</p></li>
<li><strong>Added privacy.</strong><br /><p>A parasol can also provide added privacy in your yard. This is especially useful if you have neighbors close by or if you live in a busy area. A parasol can create a more secluded and private space where you can relax and enjoy your outdoor time.</p></li>
<li><strong>Protection from rain and wind.</strong><br /><p>Some parasols are also treated with a water-repellent coating, which can provide protection from light rain and wind. This means that you can still enjoy your outdoor space even if the weather is less than ideal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With a parasol, you can create a more comfortable and private outdoor space that you can enjoy all season long.</p>
<h3>Durable and weather-resistant.</h3>

<li><strong>Water-repellent fabrics.</strong><br /><p>The fabrics used in garden furniture with a parasol are often treated with a water-repellent coating. This helps to protect the fabrics from rain and mildew damage.</p></li>
<li><strong>Easy to clean.</strong><br /><p>Garden furniture with a parasol is also easy to clean. Most of the time, you can simply wipe the furniture down with a damp cloth. If the furniture is heavily soiled, you can use a mild detergent and water.</p></li>
