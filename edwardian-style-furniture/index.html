Marquetry was seen as a way to elevate furniture pieces from mere functional objects to works of art, and it continues to be admired for its beauty and sophistication.</p>
<h3>Rich Mahogany</h3>
<p>Edwardian style furniture is often made from rich mahogany, a tropical hardwood known for its deep reddish-brown color and beautiful grain patterns. Mahogany was highly prized during the Edwardian period for its beauty, durability, and resistance to pests.</p>
