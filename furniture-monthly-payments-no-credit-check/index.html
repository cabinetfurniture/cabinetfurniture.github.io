<p>When you apply for traditional financing, the lender will typically check your credit score to determine your eligibility and interest rate. If you have a low credit score, you may be denied financing or offered a high interest rate.</p>

<h3>Monthly payments</h3>
<p>When you finance furniture with monthly payments, you will typically make a fixed payment each month until the loan is paid off. The amount of your monthly payment will depend on the amount of the loan, the interest rate, and the loan term.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed payments</strong><br /><p>One of the benefits of monthly payments is that they are fixed. This means that you will always know how much your payment will be each month, making it easy to budget for your furniture purchase.</p></li>
<li><strong>Flexible payment options</strong><br /><p>Many furniture stores offer flexible payment options, such as weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payments. This can make it easier to fit your furniture payments into your budget.</p></li>
<li><strong>No prepayment penalty</strong><br /><p>With some financing options, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty if you pay off your loan early. However, with furniture monthly payments, there is typically no prepayment penalty. This means that you can pay off your loan as early as you want without having to worry about paying a fee.</p></li>
<li><strong>Build your credit score</strong><br /><p>By making your monthly payments on time, you can build your credit score. This can help you qualify for better financing options in the future, such as lower interest rates and longer loan terms.</p></li>
