This low-maintenance characteristic makes metal tables a practical choice for busy individuals and families.</li>
  <li><strong>Durable Construction:</strong> Metal tables are typically constructed using high-quality materials and sturdy manufacturing techniques, ensuring exceptional durability. The frames are often made from solid metal rods or tubes, providing a robust foundation for the tabletop.
