<h3>Think about size and scale</h3>
<p>When choosing furniture, it's important to think about size and scale. You want to choose pieces that are the right size for your space and that are in proportion to each other. If you choose furniture that is too large or too small, it will make your space look unbalanced and cluttered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measure your space:</strong> Before you start shopping for furniture, measure your space. This will help you determine what size furniture will fit in your space. You should also measure the doorways and hallways to make sure that the furniture will be able to fit through.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the scale of your space:</strong> When choosing furniture, it's important to consider the scale of your space. If you have a small space, you'll want to choose furniture that is smaller in scale. If you have a large space, you can choose furniture that is larger in scale.</li>
<li><strong>Consider the scale of other furniture:</strong> When choosing furniture, it's also important to consider the scale of other furniture in the room. You want to choose pieces that are in proportion to each other. For example, if you have a large sofa, you'll want to choose chairs that are smaller in scale.</li>
<li><strong>Leave some space around your furniture:</strong> When placing furniture in your space, be sure to leave some space around each piece. This will help your space feel more open and airy.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>By considering delivery when choosing furniture, you can ensure that your furniture is delivered to your home safely and without damage. With HomePlus, you can choose from a variety of delivery options to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>

Warranties give you peace of mind knowing that your furniture is protected if something goes wrong.</p>
