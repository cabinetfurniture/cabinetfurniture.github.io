Invest in a chair that supports your posture, reduces strain, and promotes good circulation. Adjustable features, such as lumbar support and armrests, allow you to customize your seating position for optimal comfort.</p>
<p>Consider a standing desk to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day, improving blood flow and reducing the risk of back pain. A footrest can further enhance comfort by providing support for your feet and legs, reducing fatigue and improving posture.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the height and depth of your desk to ensure your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle when typing, and your feet rest flat on the floor or a footrest. Proper desk height minimizes strain on your wrists, neck, and shoulders.</p>
