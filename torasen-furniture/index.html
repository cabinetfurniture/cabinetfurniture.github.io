<h3>Geometric shapes</h3>
<p>Torasen furniture's minimalist designs often incorporate geometric shapes, which contribute to their clean lines and space-efficient forms.</p>
<strong>Rectangles:</strong><br /><p>Rectangles are a common shape in Torasen furniture, used to create pieces such as tables, cabinets, and shelves. The straight lines and sharp angles of rectangles provide a sense of order and stability, while the varying lengths and widths of rectangles allow for a wide range of design possibilities.</p>
<strong>Circles:</strong><br /><p>Circles are often used in Torasen furniture to create a softer, more inviting feel. Circular tables, for example, can help to create a more intimate dining experience, while circular mirrors can add a touch of elegance to any room.</p>
<strong>Squares:</strong><br /><p>Squares are another popular shape in Torasen furniture, often used to create ottomans, stools, and side tables. The clean lines and sharp angles of squares provide a sense of modernity and sophistication, while the compact size of square pieces makes them ideal for small spaces.</p>
<strong>Triangles:</strong><br /><p>Triangles are less common in Torasen furniture, but they can add a touch of visual interest and dynamism to a piece. Triangular shelves, for example, can be used to create a unique and eye-catching display, while triangular ottomans can add a touch of geometric flair to any living room.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of geometric shapes in Torasen furniture contributes to the overall minimalist aesthetic, creating pieces that are both visually appealing and space-efficient.</p>
<h3>Natural materials</h3>
<p>Torasen's commitment to creating harmonious and inviting spaces is reflected in their use of natural materials. These materials bring a sense of warmth, texture, and organic beauty to Torasen's designs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wood</strong><br /><p>Wood is the primary material used in Torasen's furniture. The natural grain and texture of wood add a sense of warmth and organic beauty to any space. Torasen uses a variety of wood species, including oak, walnut, and cherry, each with its own unique characteristics and colorations.</p>
