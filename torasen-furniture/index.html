<h3>Geometric shapes</h3>
<p>Torasen furniture's minimalist designs often incorporate geometric shapes, which contribute to their clean lines and space-efficient forms.</p>
<strong>Rectangles:</strong><br /><p>Rectangles are a common shape in Torasen furniture, used to create pieces such as tables, cabinets, and shelves. The straight lines and sharp angles of rectangles provide a sense of order and stability, while the varying lengths and widths of rectangles allow for a wide range of design possibilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wood</strong><br /><p>Wood is the primary material used in Torasen's furniture. The natural grain and texture of wood add a sense of warmth and organic beauty to any space.
