<h3>Heat Output: Choose a fire table with a heat output that's appropriate for your climate and desired level of warmth.</h3>
<p>The heat output of a fire table is measured in British Thermal Units (BTUs). The higher the BTU rating, the more heat the fire table will produce. When choosing a fire table, it is important to consider your climate and desired level of warmth.</p>

<p>If you live in a warm climate, you may prefer a fire table with a lower BTU rating. This will help to prevent the fire table from overheating your outdoor space.</p>
<p>In addition to climate, you should also consider your desired level of warmth when choosing a fire table. If you want to be able to feel the heat from the fire table, you'll want to choose a model with a higher BTU rating. If you prefer a more subtle warmth, you can choose a model with a lower BTU rating.</p>
