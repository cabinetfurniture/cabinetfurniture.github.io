<p><strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 1: The best materials for garden furniture are those that are weather-resistant and durable. Look for furniture made from teak, acacia, or eucalyptus wood, as these are naturally resistant to rot and decay. Metal furniture, such as aluminum or wrought iron, is also a good choice, as it is strong and rust-resistant.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How can I choose garden furniture that is comfortable?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: Comfort is key when choosing garden furniture. Look for pieces with cushions made from high-density foam or weather-resistant fabric.

<p><strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
Answer 3: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using weather-resistant covers when it's not in use. You should also clean and maintain your furniture regularly.

<p><strong><em>Question 4: What are some popular styles of garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 4: There are many popular styles of garden furniture to choose from. Some of the most popular include traditional, modern, and rustic. Traditional garden furniture is often made from wood and features classic designs. Modern garden furniture is characterized by clean lines and simple silhouettes. Rustic garden furniture is made from natural materials, such as wood or stone, and has a more relaxed and casual feel.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 5: How can I create a cohesive look for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer 5: To create a cohesive look for your garden furniture, choose pieces that are made from the same material and have a similar style.

<p><strong>Tip 4: Store your furniture properly during the off-season:</strong><br />
