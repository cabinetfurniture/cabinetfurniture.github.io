What kind of seating arrangements do you need? Once you have a good understanding of your needs, you can start shopping for furniture that meets those needs.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to consider when assessing the functionality of office furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task:</strong> What tasks will you be performing in your office? If you will be doing a lot of computer work, you will need a desk that is large enough to accommodate your computer and other equipment. If you will be meeting with clients, you will need a conference table and chairs.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> How much storage space do you need? If you need to store a lot of files and supplies, you will need a desk with drawers or a filing cabinet. If you need to store large items, you may need a storage cabinet or shelving unit.</li>
