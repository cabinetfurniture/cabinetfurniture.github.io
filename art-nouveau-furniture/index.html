This multi-functionality made Art Nouveau furniture ideal for small spaces or homes with limited room.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Art Nouveau designers paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that even the smallest elements of their furniture pieces were both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Handles, hinges, and other hardware were carefully crafted to complement the overall design and provide a seamless user experience.<br /></li>

</ul>
