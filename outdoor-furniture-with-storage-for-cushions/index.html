<p>Outdoor furniture with storage for cushions can be a great way to save space in your backyard or patio.</p>
<ul>

<h3>Weather-resistant</h3>
<p>Outdoor furniture with storage for cushions is often made from weather-resistant materials, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teak:</strong> Teak is a durable hardwood that is naturally resistant to rot, decay, and insects. It is a good choice for outdoor furniture that will be exposed to the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Cedar:</strong> Cedar is another durable hardwood that is resistant to rot and decay. It has a natural reddish-brown color that will weather to a silvery gray over time.</li>
