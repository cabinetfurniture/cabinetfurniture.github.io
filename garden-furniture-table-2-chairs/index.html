<h3>Size of your space</h3>
<p>The size of your space is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a garden furniture table and 2 chairs set. If you have a small space, such as a balcony or patio, you'll need to choose a set that is small enough to fit comfortably without overcrowding the space.

<ul>
<li>Measure the space where you plan to put the set. This will help you determine the maximum size that the set can be.</li>
<li>Consider the size of your guests. If you frequently entertain guests, you'll need to choose a set that is large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably.</li>
<li>Think about how you will use the set. If you only need a place to sit and relax, a smaller set will be fine. However, if you plan on using the set for dining or entertaining, you'll need a larger set that provides more space for food and drinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've considered all of these factors, you can start shopping for a garden furniture table and 2 chairs set that is the perfect size for your space.</p>
<p>In addition to the size of your space, you should also consider the style of your décor when choosing a garden furniture table and 2 chairs set. The set should complement the existing furniture and décor in your space, and it should reflect your personal style.</p>

<li>Think about the colors of your existing furniture and décor. If you have a lot of bright colors, you can choose a set that is also brightly colored. If you have a more neutral color scheme, you can choose a set that is more neutral in color.</li>
