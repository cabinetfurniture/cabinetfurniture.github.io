<ul>
<li><strong>Strong body and suspension:</strong> A sturdy body and robust suspension system are essential for protecting your furniture from damage during transit. The van should be able to handle the weight of your furniture and withstand the rigors of the journey.</li>
<li><strong>Secure tie-down points:</strong> Tie-down points allow you to secure your furniture in place within the van, preventing it from shifting or moving during transit. Look for a van with plenty of strong tie-down points to ensure your furniture remains safe and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Non-slip flooring:</strong> Non-slip flooring helps to prevent your furniture from sliding around inside the van. This is especially important when transporting furniture on ramps or inclines.</li>
