<p><strong>Types of Disabilities</strong></p>
<h2>Disability Furniture</h2>

* **Grab bars** can be installed in the bathroom or other areas of the home to provide support for people who have difficulty with balance or mobility.
* **Transfer benches** can be used to help people transfer from one surface to another, such as from a wheelchair to a bed.
Supportive furniture can make a significant difference in the lives of people with disabilities, enabling them to live more independently and comfortably.
