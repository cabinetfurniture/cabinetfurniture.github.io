<p>To protect your garden furniture from the elements, use covers or cushions when the furniture is not in use. You can also apply a sealant or protector to wooden furniture to help repel water and UV rays. If you live in an area with harsh winters, consider storing your furniture indoors during the winter months.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 4: Keep Your Furniture Clean</em></strong></p>
<p>Regular cleaning will help to keep your garden furniture looking its best and extend its lifespan. The best way to clean your furniture depends on the material. For metal furniture, use a mild soap and water solution. For wooden furniture, use a专门的木材清洁剂. For plastic furniture, use a mild detergent and water solution.</p>
