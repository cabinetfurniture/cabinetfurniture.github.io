<p><strong>2. Choose the right materials:</strong> Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to choose materials that can stand up to the weather. Durable hardwoods, weather-resistant wicker, and powder-coated steel are all good options.</p>

<p><strong>4. Don't forget about style:</strong> Of course, you want your garden furniture to look good. Choose pieces that match your personal style and the dÃ©cor of your outdoor space. You can also add your unique touch with cushions, throws, and other accessories.</p>
