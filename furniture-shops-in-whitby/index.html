Local artisans often use sustainable materials and traditional techniques that have a lower environmental impact compared to mass-produced furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the lifecycle of your furniture:</strong><br />
When purchasing furniture, think about its entire lifecycle. Choose pieces that are durable and built to last. Avoid furniture made from cheap materials that may end up in landfills after a short period of time.
