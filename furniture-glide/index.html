They are lightweight and durable, but they can be noisy on hard floors. Metal glides are more expensive than plastic glides, but they are also more durable and quieter. Rubber glides are the most expensive option, but they are also the quietest and most gentle on floors.</p>
<p>When choosing furniture glides, it is important to consider the type of flooring you have. If you have hard floors, you will need to choose glides that are made of a durable material, such as metal or rubber. If you have soft floors, you can choose glides that are made of a softer material, such as plastic.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen the right furniture glides, it is important to install them properly. Furniture glides are typically installed by screwing them into the bottom of the furniture. Make sure to screw the glides in tightly so that they do not come loose and cause damage to your floors.</p>
By following these tips, you can choose the right furniture glides for your needs and keep your floors looking their best.<h3>Make it easier to move furniture</h3>

<li><strong>Extend the life of your furniture</strong><br /><p>Furniture glides can help to extend the life of your furniture by protecting it from damage when you move it around.</p></li>
</ul>
