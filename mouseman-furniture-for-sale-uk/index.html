This iconic emblem is the hallmark of the Thompson family's craftsmanship and serves as a guarantee of authenticity. The mouse carving is typically found on the underside of a piece, such as the base of a table or the back of a chair.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity of Carving:</strong> The mouse carving should be清晰可见and well-defined. Avoid pieces where the carving is模糊or obscured.</li>
<li><strong>Placement of Carving:</strong> The mouse carving should be located on the underside of the piece, typically centered or slightly off-center.</li>
<li><strong>Accompanying Initials:</strong> In addition to the mouse carving, authentic Mouseman furniture often bears the initials of the craftsman who made it. Look for these initials alongside the mouse carving.</li>

<h3>Provenance: Research the piece's history and provenance to verify its authenticity.</h3>
<p>Establishing the provenance of a piece of Mouseman furniture can greatly enhance its value and authenticity. Provenance refers to the history of ownership and documentation that accompanies a piece, providing a clear trail of its origins.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales Records:</strong> If possible, obtain sales records or receipts that document the piece's previous ownership and purchase history.</li>
<li><strong>Exhibition Catalogues:</strong> Check if the piece has been featured in any museum exhibitions or published in catalogues. Such documentation adds credibility to its authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Family Records:</strong> If the piece has been passed down through generations, gather any family records or letters that mention its history and ownership.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> Older Mouseman pieces, especially those from the early 20th century, tend to command higher prices due to their historical significance and rarity.</li>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Limited edition pieces or those with unique designs are more sought-after and, therefore, more expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Condition:</strong> The overall condition of the piece plays a significant role in determining its price. Pieces in excellent condition with minimal wear and tear will fetch higher prices.</li>
<li><strong>Size and Type:</strong> Larger pieces, such as dining tables and dressers, are typically more expensive than smaller items like chairs or stools.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that prices can also fluctuate based on market trends and the reputation of the seller. Before making a purchase, research comparable pieces and consult with reputable dealers to get an accurate estimate of the fair market value.</p>
