<p>There are a number of ways that beeswax can kill bacteria. One way is by creating a physical barrier between the bacteria and the surface of the wood. This prevents the bacteria from attaching to the wood and forming colonies.</p>
<p>Beeswax also contains a number of compounds that have antibacterial properties. These compounds can kill bacteria on contact or prevent them from growing. Some of the most important antibacterial compounds in beeswax include propolis, honey, and royal jelly.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why beeswax is food-safe. First, beeswax is a natural material. It is not made with any synthetic chemicals or compounds that could be harmful to human health.</p>
<p>Second, beeswax is not porous. This means that it does not absorb liquids or bacteria. This makes it difficult for bacteria to grow on beeswax surfaces.</p>
<p>Finally, beeswax has antibacterial properties. This means that it can kill bacteria and prevent them from growing. This helps to keep beeswax surfaces clean and free of bacteria.</p>
<p>Overall, beeswax is a safe and natural finish for furniture that comes into contact with food. It is non-toxic, non-porous, and has antibacterial properties. This makes it a great choice for finishing things like countertops, tables, and chairs.</p>
<h3>Durable</h3>
<p>Beeswax is a very durable finish. It is resistant to scratches, heat, and water. This makes it a great choice for furniture that is used in high-traffic areas or that is exposed to the elements.</p>
<p>Beeswax is resistant to scratches because it is a hard finish. It is also resistant to heat because it has a high melting point. This means that it will not soften or melt even in hot environments.</p>
<p>Beeswax is also water-resistant. This means that it can repel water and moisture. This makes it a great choice for furniture that is used outdoors or in humid environments.</p>
<p>Overall, beeswax is a very durable finish that is resistant to scratches, heat, and water. This makes it a great choice for furniture that is used in high-traffic areas or that is exposed to the elements.</p>
