<li><strong>Get help if needed:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask the auction staff for assistance if you have any questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can increase your chances of finding the perfect garden furniture at a great price.</p>
<h3>Preview the items: Attend the preview event to inspect the furniture before the auction.</h3>
<p>One of the most important things you can do before participating in a garden furniture auction is to attend the preview event. This event typically takes place a few days before the auction and gives you an opportunity to inspect the furniture in person.</p>
<p>Take your time to walk around and examine each piece of furniture carefully. Pay attention to the condition of the furniture, including any scratches, dents, or tears. Also, be sure to test out the furniture to make sure it is comfortable and functional.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the furniture, don't hesitate to ask the auction staff. They can provide you with more information about the condition of the furniture and its history.</p>
<p>By attending the preview event, you can get a better idea of the quality of the furniture and make more informed decisions on auction day.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for previewing garden furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a measuring tape to ensure that the furniture will fit in your space.</li>
<li>Take pictures of the furniture so you can compare it to other items at the auction.</li>
<li>Ask the auction staff about any repairs or restorations that have been made to the furniture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research market value: Determine the fair market value of the items you're interested in.</h3>
<p>Before you start bidding on furniture at auction, it's important to do your research and determine the fair market value of the items you're interested in. This will help you avoid overpaying for furniture and ensure that you're getting a good deal.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to research market value. One way is to look at online auction sites, such as eBay, to see what similar items have sold for in the past. Another way is to consult with a professional appraiser. If you're buying high-end furniture, it may be worth the investment to have an appraiser evaluate the items before the auction.</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the fair market value of the furniture you're interested in, you can set a budget for yourself. This will help you stay disciplined during the auction and avoid getting caught up in the excitement of bidding.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for researching market value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the age, condition, and brand of the furniture.</li>
<li>Look for comparable items that have sold recently.</li>
<li>Factor in the cost of shipping and handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing your research, you can increase your chances of finding the perfect garden furniture at a great price.</p>
<h3>Set a budget: Decide how much you're willing to spend before the auction starts.</h3>
<p>Before you start bidding on furniture at auction, it's important to set a budget for yourself. This will help you stay disciplined during the auction and avoid getting caught up in the excitement of bidding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider your needs:</strong> Think about what you need the furniture for and how much you're willing to spend. Are you looking for a complete set of patio furniture or just a few accent pieces? Do you need the furniture to be durable and weather-resistant or are you looking for something more stylish? Once you have a good understanding of your needs, you can start to set a budget.</li>
<li><strong>Research market value:</strong> As discussed in the previous section, it's important to research the fair market value of the items you're interested in. This will help you set a realistic budget and avoid overpaying for furniture.</li>
<li><strong>Factor in additional costs:</strong> In addition to the purchase price of the furniture, you also need to factor in the cost of shipping and handling. If you're buying large or heavy pieces of furniture, the shipping costs can be significant. It's also important to consider the cost of assembly if the furniture requires it.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to your budget:</strong> Once you have set a budget, stick to it as best you can. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of bidding, but if you overspend, you could end up with buyer's remorse later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting a budget is an important part of preparing for a garden furniture auction. By following these tips, you can set a realistic budget and avoid overspending.</p>
<h3>Bid strategically: Don't get caught up in the excitement and bid more than you intended.</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that people make at auctions is getting caught up in the excitement and bidding more than they intended. This can lead to overspending and buyer's remorse later on. To avoid this, it's important to bid strategically.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for bidding strategically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set a maximum bid:</strong> Before the auction starts, decide how much you're willing to spend on each item. Once you reach your maximum bid, stop bidding, even if you think you can get the item for less.</li>
<li><strong>Bid incrementally:</strong> Don't bid large amounts at a time. Instead, bid in small increments, such as $5 or $10. This will help you stay in control of your bidding and avoid overspending.</li>
<li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> If you're feeling overwhelmed by the auction, take a break. Get some fresh air or grab a snack. This will help you clear your head and make more rational decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be afraid to pass:</strong> If you're not comfortable with the current bid price, don't be afraid to pass. There will be other opportunities to bid on similar items.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can bid strategically and avoid overspending at auction.</p>
<h3>Consider pickup and delivery costs: Factor in the cost of transporting your purchases home.</h3>
<p>When you're buying garden furniture at auction, it's important to factor in the cost of transporting your purchases home. This can be a significant expense, especially if you're buying large or heavy pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to consider when budgeting for pickup and delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The size and weight of the furniture:</strong> Larger and heavier pieces of furniture will cost more to transport.</li>
<li><strong>The distance to your home:</strong> The farther away your home is from the auction house, the more it will cost to transport the furniture.</li>
<li><strong>The availability of pickup and delivery services:</strong> Some auction houses offer pickup and delivery services, while others do not. If the auction house does not offer these services, you will need to arrange for your own transportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get an estimate of the cost of pickup and delivery, you can contact a local moving company. They will be able to provide you with a quote based on the size, weight, and distance of your move.</p>
<h3>Inspect purchases carefully: Examine your purchases thoroughly before leaving the auction site.</h3>
<p>Once you've won an item at auction, it's important to inspect it carefully before leaving the auction site. This will help you ensure that the item is in the condition that you expect and that there are no hidden defects.</p>
<p>Here are a few things to look for when inspecting your purchases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check for any damage:</strong> Look for any cracks, dents, or scratches on the furniture. If you find any damage, be sure to note it on the auction house's invoice.</li>
<li><strong>Test the furniture:</strong> If possible, test the furniture to make sure that it is in working order. This includes sitting on chairs, opening and closing drawers, and extending tables.</li>
<li><strong>Check the upholstery:</strong> If the furniture is upholstered, check the fabric for any stains, tears, or loose threads.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure all parts are included:</strong> If the furniture comes with any cushions, pillows, or other accessories, make sure that all of the pieces are included.</li>
</ul>
<p>By inspecting your purchases carefully before leaving the auction site, you can avoid any surprises down the road.</p>
<h3>Be prepared to pay: Bring cash, a check, or a credit card to pay for your purchases.</h3>
<p>When you're buying furniture at auction, it's important to be prepared to pay for your purchases. Most auction houses accept cash, checks, and credit cards. However, some auction houses may have a minimum purchase amount for credit card payments.</p>
<p>If you're paying with cash, be sure to bring the exact amount of the purchase price. Auction houses typically do not give change.</p>
<p>If you're paying with a check, make sure that the check is made out to the auction house. You should also bring a photo ID with you.</p>
<p>If you're paying with a credit card, be sure to bring the card with you and have it ready to use. You may also be asked to provide a photo ID.</p>
<p>By being prepared to pay for your purchases, you can avoid any delays or problems at the auction.</p>
