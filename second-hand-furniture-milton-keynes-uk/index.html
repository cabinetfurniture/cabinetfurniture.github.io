<h3>Tips</h3>

<p><strong>Tip 1: Consider your needs.</strong> What do you plan to use your garden furniture for? Will you be using it for dining, relaxing, or both? Once you know what you need your furniture for, you can start to narrow down your options.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Choose the right material.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, wood, and wicker.
