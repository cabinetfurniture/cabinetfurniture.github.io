<h3>May warp or crack if not properly cared for</h3>
<p>One of the biggest cons of mango wood furniture is that it may warp or crack if not properly cared for.

This can be done by applying a sealant or finish to the wood. The sealant or finish will help to protect the wood from moisture and other environmental factors.</p></li>
<li><strong>Regular maintenance</strong><br /><p>In addition to sealing and protecting the wood, it is also important to regularly maintain your mango wood furniture. This includes dusting and cleaning the furniture regularly, and avoiding placing it in direct sunlight or near heat sources.</p></li>
