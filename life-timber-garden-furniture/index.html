<ul>
<li><strong>Teak:</strong> Teak is a naturally durable wood that is resistant to rot, decay, and insects. It is also a very strong wood, making it ideal for outdoor furniture.</li>

<h3>Weather resistance</h3>
<p>Weather resistance is another important factor to consider when choosing life timber garden furniture. You want furniture that will be able to withstand the elements, including rain, sun, and wind.</p>
<p>Teak is a naturally weather-resistant wood. It is resistant to rot, decay, and insects, and it can withstand extreme temperatures and moisture. Mahogany is another weather-resistant wood, although it is not as durable as teak. Cypress is also a weather-resistant wood, but it is not as strong as teak or mahogany.</p>
<p>Redwood is a naturally weather-resistant wood. It is resistant to rot, decay, and insects, and it can withstand extreme temperatures and moisture. Redwood is also a very strong wood, making it ideal for outdoor furniture.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing a weather-resistant wood, you can also protect your life timber garden furniture by applying a sealant or stain. This will help to protect the wood from the elements and extend its lifespan.</p>

<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>Comfort is an important factor to consider when choosing life timber garden furniture. You want furniture that is comfortable to sit in, even for long periods of time.</p>

<p>The cushions on the furniture can also affect its comfort. Choose cushions that are made from a comfortable material, such as foam or feathers. The thickness of the cushions can also affect their comfort. Thicker cushions are more comfortable than thin cushions.</p>
<p>By choosing comfortable life timber garden furniture, you can ensure that you and your guests will be able to relax and enjoy your outdoor space.</p>
<p>In addition to the factors mentioned above, you may also want to consider the following when choosing comfortable life timber garden furniture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Traditional life timber garden furniture is typically made from teak or mahogany. It is characterized by its classic design and elegant lines.</li>

  <li><strong>Rustic:</strong> Rustic life timber garden furniture is typically made from reclaimed wood or other natural materials. It is characterized by its rugged appearance and natural beauty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Larger furniture will also be more expensive than smaller furniture. For example, a six-seater dining table will be more expensive than a four-seater dining table.</p>
