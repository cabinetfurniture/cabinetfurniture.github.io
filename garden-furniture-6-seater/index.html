<ul>
<li><strong>Cushions:</strong> The cushions on your outdoor furniture should be firm enough to provide support, but soft enough to be comfortable. Look for cushions that are made from weather-resistant fabrics that will not fade or mildew.</li>

If you have a more modern home, you may prefer furniture with a contemporary look. Ultimately, the best way to choose the right style is to consider your own personal taste and the overall aesthetic of your outdoor space.</p>
<p>Here are a few popular styles of 6-seater garden furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Traditional garden furniture is typically made from wood or metal and features classic designs. This style of furniture is often found in formal gardens and outdoor spaces.</li>
