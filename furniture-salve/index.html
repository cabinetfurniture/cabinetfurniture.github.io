It fills in Ð¼ÐµÐ»ÐºÐ¸Ðµ ÑÐ°ÑÐ°Ð¿Ð¸Ð½Ñ and imperfections, creating a smooth and even surface. As beeswax buffs up, it generates heat, which helps to melt and spread the wax, resulting in a beautiful sheen.</p>

<p><strong>Lemon essential oil:</strong><br />
Lemon essential oil's fresh, citrusy scent helps to deodorize and freshen the wood. It also helps to remove stubborn stains and discoloration, revealing the wood's natural luster.</p>
<p>When combined, these natural ingredients work together to restore the wood's natural luster and beauty. Regular application of furniture salve can help to keep your wooden furniture looking its best, year after year.</p>

<p><strong>1. Keep your garden furniture covered when not in use.</strong><br />
This will help to protect your furniture from the elements, such as rain, snow, and sunlight. You can use a tarp, a furniture cover, or even a large plastic bag to cover your furniture.</p>
<p><strong>2. Store your garden furniture in a dry place during the winter months.</strong><br />
If you live in an area with harsh winters, it is important to store your garden furniture in a dry place during the winter months. This will help to prevent the wood from rotting or warping.</p>
<p><strong>3. Clean your garden furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution.</strong><br />
This will help to remove dirt and grime, and it will also help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Be sure to rinse the furniture thoroughly after cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>4. Apply furniture salve to your garden furniture every few months.</strong><br />
Furniture salve is a natural and gentle way to protect and preserve your wooden garden furniture. It helps to nourish and condition the wood, and it also helps to protect it from the elements. You can find furniture salve at most hardware stores or online.</p>
