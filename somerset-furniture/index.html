<p>The Tudor period, spanning from 1485 to 1603, marked a significant era in English furniture history. Tudor furniture was characterized by its intricate carvings, geometric patterns, and a blend of Gothic and Renaissance influences.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elaborate Carvings:</strong> Tudor furniture showcased a profusion of elaborate carvings, often featuring intricate designs of foliage, animals, and mythical creatures. These carvings added a sense of opulence and grandeur to the furniture pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Geometric Patterns:</strong> Geometric patterns were another prominent feature of Tudor furniture. These patterns were often incorporated into the furniture's panels, moldings, and other decorative elements, creating a sense of order and symmetry.</li>
<li><strong>Gothic Influence:</strong> Tudor furniture retained some of the Gothic influences from the preceding period, such as the use of pointed arches and quatrefoil motifs. These elements added a touch of medieval charm to the furniture.</li>
<li><strong>Renaissance Influence:</strong> The Tudor period also witnessed the growing influence of the Renaissance, which brought about a shift towards more classical forms and motifs. This influence can be seen in the incorporation of pilasters, columns, and other architectural elements into furniture design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tudor furniture was predominantly made from oak, which was a readily available and durable material. The furniture was often stained or painted in dark colors, such as black, brown, or green, to enhance the intricate carvings and patterns.</p>
<h3>Jacobean: Bold forms, heavy decoration</h3>
<p>The Jacobean period, spanning from 1603 to 1688, saw a continuation of the bold and ornate style that had emerged during the Tudor era. Jacobean furniture was characterized by its heavy decoration, exaggerated forms, and a mix of influences from both Gothic and Renaissance styles.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Heavy Decoration:</strong> Jacobean furniture was heavily decorated with carvings, moldings, and other decorative elements. These decorations often incorporated motifs such as acanthus leaves, strapwork, and cherubs.</li>
<li><strong>Gothic Influence:</strong> Jacobean furniture retained some of the Gothic influences from the previous period, such as the use of pointed arches and quatrefoil motifs. However, these elements were often combined with more Renaissance-inspired forms and motifs.</li>
<li><strong>Renaissance Influence:</strong> The Renaissance influence on Jacobean furniture can be seen in the use of classical motifs such as pilasters, columns, and pediments. These elements added a touch of sophistication and elegance to the furniture.</li>

<h3>William and Mary: Curved lines, Dutch influence</h3>
<p>The William and Mary period, spanning from 1688 to 1702, marked a significant shift in English furniture design. Influenced by the Dutch style, William and Mary furniture introduced a new emphasis on comfort, functionality, and curved lines.</p>
<p>One of the most distinctive features of William and Mary furniture is its use of curved lines. This can be seen in the cabriole legs, which are curved outwards from the knee, as well as in the shaped aprons and crest rails. These curved lines create a sense of movement and gracefulness, departing from the more rigid forms of the previous Jacobean period.</p>
<p>Another defining characteristic of William and Mary furniture is the strong influence of Dutch design. This influence can be seen in the use of marquetry, which is the inlay of different colored woods to create decorative patterns.

<p>William and Mary furniture was also characterized by its use of walnut as the primary wood. Walnut is a durable and attractive wood with a rich, warm color. The use of walnut gave William and Mary furniture a more refined and sophisticated appearance compared to the oak furniture of the previous period.</p>

Look for furniture with supportive cushions and adjustable backs. You may also want to consider adding some throw pillows for extra comfort.
