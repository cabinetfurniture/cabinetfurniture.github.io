<h3>Svara-Kembali</h3>
<p>Svara-Kembali, literally meaning "self-returning," is a unique feature of Indonesian language that allows words or phrases to be repeated with a slight change in pronunciation or stress. This repetition can serve various grammatical and stylistic functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Penekanan (Emphasis)</strong><br /><p>Repeating a word or phrase with increased stress emphasizes its importance or significance. For example:
<br /><em>Saya sangat senang, sangat senang sekali bertemu dengan Anda.</em><br />
(I am very, very happy to meet you.)</p></li>
<li><strong>Pengulangan (Repetition)</strong><br /><p>Repeating a word or phrase without significant change in pronunciation or stress creates a sense of repetition or continuity. For example:
<br /><em>Dia berlari, berlari, berlari tanpa henti.</em><br />
(He ran, and ran, and ran without stopping.)</p></li>
<li><strong>Intensifikasi (Intensification)</strong><br /><p>Repeating a word or phrase with a change in intonation or stress can intensify its meaning. For example:
<br /><em>Saya tidak hanya suka, saya cinta kamu.</em><br />
(I don't just like you, I love you.)</p></li>
<li><strong>Deskripsi (Description)</strong><br /><p>Repeating a word or phrase with a change in pronunciation or stress can create a descriptive effect. For example:
<br /><em>Daunnya hijau, hijau seperti zamrud.</em><br />
(The leaves are green, green like emeralds.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Svara-Kembali adds richness and expressiveness to the Indonesian language, allowing speakers to convey subtle nuances of meaning and emotion.</p>
