<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional French Polishing:</strong> This is the most traditional method of French polishing, and it uses a shellac-based finish. Shellac is a natural resin that is dissolved in alcohol, and it is applied to the wood in thin layers. Each layer is then polished with a rubbing pad to create a smooth, glossy finish.</li>

These finishes are more durable than shellac, and they can be applied more quickly. However, they do not produce the same depth of gloss as traditional French polishing.</li>
