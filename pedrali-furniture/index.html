<p><strong>Tip 1: Consider Your Space:</strong> Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take some time to measure your outdoor space and consider how you want to use it.

Look for chairs and sofas with good lumbar support and cushions that are firm but not too hard. You may also want to consider adding throw pillows and blankets to make your seating area even more inviting.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Add Personal Touches:</strong> Once you've chosen your garden furniture, you can add personal touches to make it truly your own.
