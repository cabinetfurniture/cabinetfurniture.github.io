            <p>In the world of furniture, the name Stag stands for quality, craftsmanship, and timeless design. For over a century, Stag furniture has graced homes across the UK and beyond, earning a reputation for its durability, elegance, and attention to detail.</p>
<p>The Stag furniture story began in the early 20th century, when a group of skilled cabinetmakers came together in London with a shared passion for creating beautiful and functional furniture. Inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, they believed that furniture should not only be aesthetically pleasing but also built to last. Using traditional techniques and the finest materials, they crafted pieces that would become cherished heirlooms, passed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Over the years, Stag furniture has evolved to reflect changing tastes and lifestyles, while always staying true to its core values of quality and craftsmanship. Today, Stag furniture is available in a wide range of styles, from traditional to modern, and is still made using the same time-honored techniques that have made the brand so renowned.</p>
