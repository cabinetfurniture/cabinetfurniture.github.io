<h3>Machine-washable for easy cleaning.</h3>
<p>One of the best things about furniture protecting cloths is that they are machine-washable, making them incredibly easy to clean. This is especially important if you have pets or children, as spills and accidents are bound to happen.</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Prevents stains from setting:</strong><br /><p>If you spill something on your furniture, it's important to clean it up as soon as possible to prevent the stain from setting. Machine-washing your furniture protecting cloth is the quickest and easiest way to do this.</p></li>
<li><strong>Keeps your furniture looking its best:</strong><br /><p>Regularly washing your furniture protecting cloth will help to keep your furniture looking its best. By removing dirt, dust, and stains, you can prevent your furniture from becoming dull or faded.</p></li>

<p>Custom-made furniture protecting cloths are available from a variety of online retailers and local home goods stores. You can also find custom-made cloths from upholsterers and other furniture professionals.</p>
<p>To order a custom-made furniture protecting cloth, you will need to provide the retailer or professional with the measurements of your furniture. You may also need to provide them with a photo of your furniture so that they can see the shape and style.</p>
<p>Once you have ordered your custom-made furniture protecting cloth, you can expect to receive it within a few weeks. Once you receive your cloth, simply put it on your furniture and enjoy the peace of mind knowing that your furniture is protected.</p><h3>Can be used indoors or outdoors.</h3>
