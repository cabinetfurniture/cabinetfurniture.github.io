            <p>Heywood-Wakefield is a renowned American furniture maker known for its high-quality and stylish pieces. If you're lucky enough to own a piece of Heywood-Wakefield furniture, you may be wondering how to identify its age and origin. One of the best ways to do this is by examining the furniture's label.</p>
<p>Heywood-Wakefield furniture labels have evolved over the years, but they all share some common features. Most labels include the company name, the city and state where the furniture was made, and a date code. The date code can be used to determine the year the furniture was manufactured. In addition to these basic features, some labels also include information about the furniture's style, model number, and finish.</p><h2>heywood wakefield furniture labels</h2>
<p>Here are five important points about Heywood-Wakefield furniture labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include company name</li>
<li>Indicate city and state of manufacture</li>
<li>Feature a date code</li>
<li>May provide style and model information</li>
<li>Can help determine furniture's age and origin</li>
</ul>
<p>By examining the label on your Heywood-Wakefield furniture, you can learn more about its history and value.</p><h3>Include company name</h3>
<p>The company name is one of the most important pieces of information on a Heywood-Wakefield furniture label. It not only identifies the manufacturer, but it can also help to date the piece. Heywood-Wakefield furniture was made by the Heywood-Wakefield Company, which was founded in 1897. The company's name was changed to Heywood-Wakefield in 1903.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labels with the Heywood-Wakefield name</strong><br /><p>Indicate that the furniture was made after 1903.</p></li>
<li><strong>Labels with the Heywood Brothers name</strong><br /><p>Indicate that the furniture was made before 1903.</p></li>
<li><strong>Labels with the Heywood-Wakefield Company name</strong><br /><p>Indicate that the furniture was made between 1897 and 1903.</p></li>
<li><strong>Labels with the Heywood Brothers and Wakefield Company name</strong><br /><p>Indicate that the furniture was made between 1896 and 1897.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By identifying the company name on the label, you can narrow down the possible manufacturing date of your Heywood-Wakefield furniture.</p><h3>Indicate city and state of manufacture</h3>
pCThe city and state of manufacture is another important piece of information found on Heywood Sharpe Furniture labels. This information can help you to narrow down the possible origins of your piece. Heywood-Wakefield furniture was made in a number of different cities and states over the years, including:
<ul>
<li><strong> Gardner, Massachusetts</strong> (1826-1927)</li>
<li><strong> Wakefield, Massachusetts</strong> (1854-1927)</li>
<li><strong> Chicago, Illinois</strong> (1890-1954)</li>
<li><strong> Menominee, Michigan</strong> (1892-1927)</li>
<li><strong> Louisville, Kentucky</strong> (1903-1927)</li>
</ul>
If the label on your Heywood-Wakefield piece includes the city and state of manufacture, you can use this information to research the history of the company's operations in that area. This can help you to date your piece more accurately.
In addition to the city and state of manufacture, some Heywood-Wakefield furniture labels also include the factory number. This information can be used to identify the specific factory where your piece was made. This information can be helpful for dating your piece and for learning more about its history.<h3>Feature a date code</h3>
<p>The date code is one of the most important pieces of information found on a Heywood-Wakefield furniture label. This code can be used to determine the year in which the furniture was manufactured. Heywood-Wakefield used a variety of different date codes over the years, but the most common format is a two-digit year code followed by a letter code. The letter code indicates the month in which the furniture was made. The following table shows the letter codes used by Heywood-Wakefield:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> = January</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> = February</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> = March</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> = April</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> = May</li>
<li><strong>F</strong> = June</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> = July</li>
<li><strong>H</strong> = August</li>
<li><strong>I</strong> = September</li>
<li><strong>J</strong> = October</li>
<li><strong>K</strong> = November</li>
<li><strong>L</strong> = December</li>
</ul>
For example, a date code of "23K" would indicate that the furniture was manufactured in November of 1923.
If the label on your Heywood-Wakefield piece includes a date code, you can use this information to determine the exact year in which the furniture was made. This can be helpful for dating your piece and for learning more about its history.<h3>May provide style and model information</h3>
<p>In addition to the company name, city and state of manufacture, and date code, some Heywood-Wakefield furniture labels also include information about the furniture's style and model number. This information can be helpful for identifying the specific piece of furniture that you have and for learning more about its history.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Style information</strong><br /><p>Heywood-Wakefield furniture was made in a variety of different styles, including Mission, Arts and Crafts, and Art Deco. The style of your furniture can be identified by its overall design, as well as by the details of its construction. For example, Mission furniture is typically made of oak or other dark woods and features simple, straight lines. Arts and Crafts furniture is often made of lighter woods and features more elaborate carvings and decoration. Art Deco furniture is characterized by its sleek, geometric lines and its use of exotic materials, such as chrome and Bakelite.</p></li>
<li><strong>Model number</strong><br /><p>Heywood-Wakefield furniture was also assigned model numbers. The model number can be found on the furniture's label, as well as on the bottom of the piece itself. The model number can be used to identify the specific piece of furniture that you have and to learn more about its history. For example, you can use the model number to find out when the piece was made, what materials were used to make it, and what its original price was.</p></li>
</ul>
If the label on your Heywood-Wakefield furniture includes style and model information, you can use this information to learn more about the history of your piece and to identify its specific design.<h3>Can help determine furniture's age and origin</h3>
<p>The information found on a furniture label can help you to determine your furniture's age and origin. The company name, city and state of manufacture, date code, style information, and model number can all be used to narrow down the possible dates and locations of your furniture's production.</p>
<p>For example, if your furniture's label indicates that it was made by the "Heywood-Wakefield Company" in "Gardner, Massachusetts" and has a date code of "23K", you can conclude that your furniture was made in November of 1923 in Gardner, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Once you have determined your furniture's age and origin, you can begin to research its history. You can use the information on the label to search for information about the company that made your furniture, the style of your furniture, and the history of your furniture's original location. This information can help you to learn more about your furniture's value and to appreciate its unique history.</p><h3>FAQ</h3>
