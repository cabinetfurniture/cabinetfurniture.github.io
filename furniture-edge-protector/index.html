<h3>Helps to prevent injuries</h3>
<p>Furniture edge protectors are an effective way to prevent injuries in children. Sharp edges and corners on furniture can easily cause cuts, bruises, and even concussions. Furniture edge protectors can help to prevent these injuries by creating a barrier between the child and the sharp edge.</p>

<p>Even a minor fall onto a sharp edge can cause serious injuries. A cut on the head can require stitches, and a concussion can cause headaches, nausea, and vomiting. In some cases, a serious injury can even be life-threatening.</p>
