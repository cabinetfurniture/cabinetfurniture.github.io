Measure the length, width, and height of the area where you plan to put your furniture, and then compare those measurements to the dimensions of the furniture you're considering.
* **Consider your climate.** If you live in a climate with harsh winters, you'll need to choose furniture that is durable enough to withstand the elements. Look for furniture made from materials that are resistant to rot and decay, such as teak or aluminum.
* **Protect your furniture from the elements.** Even if you live in a mild climate, it's still a good idea to protect your garden furniture from the sun and rain. Cover your furniture with a tarp or other protective covering when you're not using it, and store it in a dry place during the winter months.
By following these tips, you can choose the perfect garden furniture set for your needs and enjoy it for years to come.
