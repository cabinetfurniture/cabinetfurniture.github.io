<p>Here are a few tips for cooking with a fire pit:</p>

<li><strong>Place the cooking grate over the fire:</strong> Once you have a hot fire, place the cooking grate over the fire pit. Make sure the grate is stable and won't tip over.</li>
<li><strong>Preheat the cooking grate:</strong> Preheat the cooking grate for a few minutes before you start cooking. This will help to prevent food from sticking to the grate.</li>
<li><strong>Cook your food:</strong> Once the cooking grate is preheated, you can start cooking your food. Cook food over medium-high heat, and flip it regularly to prevent it from burning.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little practice, you'll be able to cook delicious meals on your patio furniture set with a fire pit. This is a great way to enjoy your outdoor space and entertain your guests.</p>
