<p><strong><em>Tip 4: Maintain Your Furniture Regularly:</em></strong><br />
To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture and keep it looking its best, regular maintenance is essential. Clean your furniture regularly with a mild detergent and water, and apply a protective sealant or finish to protect it from the elements. You should also store your furniture in a dry place when not in use.</p>
