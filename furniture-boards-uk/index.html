<h3>Wide range of materials.</h3>
<p>The furniture board market in the UK boasts a diverse selection of materials, catering to a wide spectrum of design aesthetics, functional requirements, and budget constraints. Here are some commonly used materials:</p>
<p><strong>Medium-density fibreboard (MDF):</strong> MDF is an engineered wood product composed of wood fibers, resin, and wax. It is known for its smooth, uniform surface, making it an excellent choice for painting, laminating, or veneering. MDF is versatile and can be used for a variety of applications, including cabinets, shelves, and furniture frames.</p>
<p><strong>Particle board:</strong> Similar to MDF, particle board is an engineered wood product made from wood particles, resin, and wax. It is a cost-effective option for furniture and cabinetry. Particle board is typically used for interior applications, as it is not as moisture-resistant as MDF.</p>
<p><strong>Plywood:</strong> Plywood is a composite material made of thin layers of wood veneer glued together under pressure. It is known for its strength, durability, and dimensional stability. Plywood is commonly used for furniture, flooring, and structural applications.</p>
<p><strong>Solid wood:</strong> Solid wood is a natural material derived from the trunk of a tree. It is prized for its beauty, durability, and strength. Solid wood is commonly used for high-end furniture, cabinetry, and architectural elements.</p>

They are typically made of steel or aluminum and can be finished in a variety of colors and textures.

It can be used to create a seamless look, add a decorative touch, or provide protection from moisture and wear. Edge banding is available in a variety of materials and colors, allowing for further customization.</p>
<p><strong>Veneering:</strong> Veneering is the process of applying a thin layer of wood or other material to the surface of a furniture board. This can be done to improve the appearance of the board, to make it more durable, or to create a specific design.
