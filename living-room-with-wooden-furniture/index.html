<li><strong>Distressed finish:</strong> A distressed finish gives the wood a worn or aged look. This type of finish is a good choice for living rooms with a more rustic or industrial style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have chosen a finish, you can apply it to your wooden furniture using aå·å­, a roller, or a spray gun. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for applying the finish.</p>
