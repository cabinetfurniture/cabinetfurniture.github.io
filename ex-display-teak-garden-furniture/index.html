</ul>
<p>If you find any damage to the furniture, be sure to ask the seller about it. They may be able to repair the damage or offer you a discount on the price. However, if the damage is significant, you may want to consider looking for another piece of furniture.</p>
<p>In addition to checking for visible damage, you should also test the furniture to make sure it is sturdy and well-made. Sit in the chairs and make sure they are comfortable. Open and close the drawers and doors to make sure they work smoothly. Check the tabletops and other surfaces to make sure they are level and free of any wobbles.</p>
<p>By taking the time to inspect the furniture carefully, you can avoid buying a piece that is damaged or poorly made. This will help you ensure that you get the most enjoyment out of your new teak garden furniture.</p>
<p>Once you have inspected the furniture and are satisfied with its condition, you can start negotiating the price. Be sure to keep in mind that ex display furniture is often sold at a discount, so you should be able to get a good deal.</p>
<h3>Ask the seller about the furniture's history.</h3>
<p>Once you have inspected the furniture and are satisfied with its condition, the next step is to ask the seller about its history. This will help you determine how well the furniture has been cared for and whether it is likely to last for many years to come.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How long has the furniture been on display?</strong><br /><p>This will give you an idea of how much wear and tear the furniture has been subjected to. If the furniture has been on display for a long time, it is more likely to have some minor cosmetic flaws, such as scratches or dents. However, it is also more likely to have been well-maintained and to be in good overall condition.</p></li>
<li><strong>Why is the furniture being sold?</strong><br /><p>The seller may be able to provide you with some valuable information about the furniture's history. For example, they may tell you that the furniture is being sold because it is no longer needed for display purposes or because it is being replaced with newer furniture. This information can help you assess the furniture's value and make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase it.</p></li>
<li><strong>Has the furniture been used or damaged?</strong><br /><p>If the furniture has been used, be sure to ask the seller about any damage that may have occurred. The seller should be able to tell you about any repairs that have been made and whether or not the furniture is still in good working condition.</p></li>
<li><strong>Is the furniture covered by a warranty?</strong><br /><p>Some ex display furniture may be covered by a warranty. This can give you peace of mind knowing that you are protected in case of any defects or damage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By asking the seller about the furniture's history, you can get a better understanding of its condition and value. This information can help you make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase the furniture.</p>
<h3>Be prepared to negotiate on the price.</h3>
<p>Ex display teak garden furniture is often sold at a discount, but that doesn't mean you should be afraid to negotiate on the price. Here are a few tips to help you get the best possible deal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your research.</strong><br /><p>Before you start negotiating, it's important to do your research and know what the furniture is worth. This will give you a good starting point for negotiations.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong><br /><p>If the seller is not willing to negotiate on the price, be prepared to walk away. There are plenty of other ex display teak garden furniture pieces on the market, so you don't have to settle for a price that you're not comfortable with.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be willing to compromise.</strong><br /><p>Negotiation is all about compromise. Be willing to meet the seller halfway, but don't be afraid to stand your ground if you're not happy with the price.</p></li>
<li><strong>Be polite and respectful.</strong><br /><p>Even if you're negotiating hard, it's important to be polite and respectful to the seller. Remember, you're both trying to get a good deal.</p></li>
</ul>
