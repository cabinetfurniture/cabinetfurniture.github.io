For deeper cleaning, standard household disinfectants can be used without fear of damaging the material.</li>
  <li><strong>Resistance to Mold and Mildew:</strong> Stainless steel's resistance to moisture and humidity makes it an excellent choice for bathrooms, where mold and mildew can thrive. Its non-porous surface prevents the accumulation of moisture, effectively eliminating the conditions necessary for mold and mildew growth.</li>
