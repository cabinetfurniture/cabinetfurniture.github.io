Create a focal point in your garden to draw the eye and add interest. This could be a stunning water feature, a vibrant potted plant, or a piece of eye-catching garden art. The focal point will serve as a central element around which you can arrange your garden furniture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 4: Consider Lighting:</em></strong><br />
Don't forget about lighting when designing your garden furniture arrangement. String lights, lanterns, and solar-powered lights can create a magical ambiance and extend the usability of your outdoor space into the evening hours.</p>
