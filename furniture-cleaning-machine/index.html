<li><strong>Dry cleaning:</strong><br /><p>Dry cleaning machines use absorbent powders or foams to clean furniture and carpets. These powders or foams encapsulate dirt and debris, which are then vacuumed up, leaving the surface clean and refreshed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With their advanced cleaning technologies, furniture cleaning machines can effectively remove a wide range of stains, including coffee, wine, pet stains, and more. They also help to eliminate odors and allergens, leaving your furniture and carpets looking and smelling fresh and clean.</p>

<li><strong>Hard floor cleaning:</strong><br /><p>Some furniture cleaning machines come with attachments that allow them to clean hard floors, such as tile, hardwood, and laminate. These attachments typically use a combination of brushes and suction to remove dirt and grime from hard surfaces.</p></li>
<li><strong>Spot cleaning:</strong><br /><p>Furniture cleaning machines can also be used for spot cleaning specific stains on furniture or carpets. This is particularly useful for removing fresh stains before they set in and become more difficult to remove.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With their multiple cleaning methods, furniture cleaning machines provide a versatile solution for maintaining clean and fresh furniture, carpets, and hard floors throughout your home or office.</p>

These allergens can trigger allergies and asthma symptoms, so their removal can significantly improve indoor air quality and reduce the risk of allergic reactions.</p></li>
<li><strong>Odor elimination:</strong><br /><p>Furniture cleaning machines can eliminate unpleasant odors from furniture and carpets, such as pet odors, smoke odors, and food odors. This is achieved through the use of specialized cleaning solutions and deodorizing agents that neutralize and remove odor-causing bacteria and particles.</p></li>
<li><strong>Improved air circulation:</strong><br /><p>By removing dirt, dust, and allergens from furniture and carpets, furniture cleaning machines improve air circulation throughout the room. This allows for better airflow, which can help to reduce the concentration of pollutants and improve overall air quality.</p></li>
