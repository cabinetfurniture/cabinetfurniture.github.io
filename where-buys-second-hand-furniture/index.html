These stores are run by charitable organizations and rely on donations from the community.

<p>Consignment shops are another great option for finding secondhand furniture. These stores sell items that have been consigned to them by individuals.

<li><strong>Bring cash:</strong><br /><p>Most garage sales are cash-only, so be sure to bring enough cash with you. It's also a good idea to bring small bills, as many sellers may not have change for large bills.</p></li>
