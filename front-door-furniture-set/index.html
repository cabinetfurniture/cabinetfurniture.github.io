<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional homes:</strong> Traditional homes typically have a more formal look, so a finish like brass or oil-rubbed bronze would be a good choice.</li>
<li><strong>Modern homes:</strong> Modern homes have a more sleek and contemporary look, so a finish like nickel or chrome would be a good choice.</li>
