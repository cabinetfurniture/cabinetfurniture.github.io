  Oak effect furniture board is a type of wood-based panel that is made to look like oak wood. It is a popular choice for making furniture and other decorative purposes in places like Japan, because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to work with, while still providing a high-quality look.

  Oak effect furniture board is made from a variety of materials, including medium-density fiberboard (MDF), particleboard, and plywood.
