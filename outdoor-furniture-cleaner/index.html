<h3>Removes tough stains</h3>
<p>One of the most important factors to consider when choosing an outdoor furniture cleaner is its ability to remove tough stains. Outdoor furniture is often exposed to a variety of stains, including food, drinks, dirt, and pollen. A good outdoor furniture cleaner will be able to remove these stains without damaging the finish of your furniture.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water-based</strong><br /><p>Water-based outdoor furniture cleaner are the most common type of cleaner.

<h3>Protects against fading</h3>
<p>One of the most important things you can do to protect your outdoor furniture is to choose a cleaner that contains UV protectants. UV rays from the sun can cause the color of your furniture to fade over time. A good outdoor furniture cleaner will contain UV protectants that will help to shield your furniture from the sun's harmful rays.</p>
<p>There are two main types of UV protectants: chemical and physical. Chemical UV protectants absorb UV rays and convert them into heat. Physical UV protectants reflect UV rays away from the surface of your furniture.</p>
<p>Both types of UV protectants are effective at preventing fading. However, chemical UV protectants can break down over time, so it is important to reapply them regularly. Physical UV protectants do not break down over time, so they provide long-lasting protection.</p>
<p>When choosing an outdoor furniture cleaner, look for one that contains both chemical and physical UV protectants. This will provide your furniture with the best possible protection against fading.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can choose an outdoor furniture cleaner that will help to keep your furniture looking its best for years to come.</p>
<h3>Extends furniture life</h3>
<p>In addition to protecting your furniture from fading, a good outdoor furniture cleaner will also help to extend its life. Dirt, grime, and stains can all damage the finish of your furniture over time. A good cleaner will remove these contaminants and help to keep your furniture looking its best.</p>
<p>In addition, some outdoor furniture cleaners contain ingredients that can help to protect your furniture from the elements. These ingredients can help to prevent rust, corrosion, and mildew.</p>
<p>By using a good outdoor furniture cleaner on a regular basis, you can help to extend the life of your furniture and keep it looking its best for years to come.</p>
<p>Now that we've discussed the benefits of using an outdoor furniture cleaner, let's move on to the next important factor to consider: environmental friendliness.</p>
<h3>Environmentally friendly</h3>
<p>When choosing an outdoor furniture cleaner, it's important to consider the environmental impact of the product. Some outdoor furniture cleaners contain harsh chemicals that can be harmful to the environment. These chemicals can pollute waterways and harm wildlife.</p>
