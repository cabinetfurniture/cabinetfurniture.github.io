<p>You will be spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, so make sure it is comfortable to sit in. Also, choose furniture that matches the style of your home and garden.

If you have a more modern home, you may want to choose contemporary furniture made from plastic or wicker.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Care for your garden furniture regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, clean it regularly with a mild detergent and water. You should also apply a sealant or stain to protect it from the elements. If you live in an area with harsh winters, you should store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months.</p>
