<p>You will be spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, so make sure it is comfortable to sit in. Also, choose furniture that matches the style of your home and garden.

<p>To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, clean it regularly with a mild detergent and water. You should also apply a sealant or stain to protect it from the elements. If you live in an area with harsh winters, you should store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months.</p>
