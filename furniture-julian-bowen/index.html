<p><strong><em>Question 4: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
Answer: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using covers or storing it in a sheltered area when not in use. Covers are available in a variety of materials, including waterproof and UV-resistant fabrics. If you don't have a sheltered area, apply a protective sealant to your furniture to help protect it from moisture and fading.</p>

Answer: Regular maintenance is key to keeping your garden furniture looking its best and延长 its lifespan. Clean your furniture regularly using mild soap and water. For metal furniture, use a metal polish to prevent rust and keep it shiny. For wooden furniture, apply a protective sealant or oil to protect it from moisture and fading. Additionally, tighten any loose screws or bolts to ensure the furniture remains sturdy and safe.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find high-quality garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: You can find high-quality garden furniture at a variety of retailers, both online and in-store. Look for reputable brands that are known for their quality and craftsmanship.
