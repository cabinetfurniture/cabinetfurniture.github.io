<h3>Choose the right shade of gold.</h3>
<p>The shade of gold you choose will have a big impact on the overall look of your bedroom. If you want a more traditional look, opt for a deep, rich gold. For a more modern look, choose a lighter, more yellow gold. And if you want a more eclectic look, mix and match different shades of gold.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm golds</strong>, such as brass and yellow gold, are perfect for creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Cool golds</strong>, such as white gold and rose gold, are more modern and sophisticated.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral golds</strong>, such as champagne gold and gold leaf, can be used to create a variety of different looks.</li>
