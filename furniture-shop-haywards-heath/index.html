Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and rattan. Wood is a popular choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and weather resistance. Plastic is a budget-friendly option that comes in a wide range of colors and styles. Rattan, made from natural fibers, offers a unique and elegant look.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How can I choose the right size garden furniture for my space?</em></strong><br />
Answer 2: When selecting garden furniture, it's important to consider the size of your outdoor space. Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture to ensure that it fits comfortably without overcrowding. Take into account the size of your patio or deck, as well as the number of people you typically entertain.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: What are some tips for maintaining garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
