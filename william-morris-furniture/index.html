<li><strong>Solid Brass and Iron:</strong><br /><p>Morris bevorzuged solid brass and iron for his metalwork accents. These materials were strong, durable, and resistant to corrosion. They also developed a beautiful patina over time, adding to the charm and character of his furniture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Morris's ornate metalwork accents were a key element of his furniture designs. They added a touch of luxury and refinement, while still maintaining the overall simplicity and functionality of his pieces.</p>
<h3>Ethical Production</h3>
<p>William Morris was deeply concerned about the working conditions of his employees. He believed that workers should be treated fairly and paid a living wage. He also believed that the production of furniture should be sustainable and environmentally responsible.</p>
<p>In 1861, Morris founded Morris &amp; Co., a furniture and design company that was committed to ethical production. Morris &amp; Co. paid its workers fair wages and provided them with safe and healthy working conditions. The company also used sustainable materials and practices whenever possible.</p>
