<p>If you're considering using teal paint to transform your garden furniture, here are answers to some commonly asked questions:</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 1: Is teal paint suitable for outdoor furniture?</em></strong><br />Yes, teal paint can be used on outdoor furniture as long as it is specifically designed for exterior use. Look for paint with UV protection to prevent fading and ensure durability.</p>
