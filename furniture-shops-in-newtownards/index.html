<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Have questions about garden furniture? We've got answers! Here's a collection of frequently asked questions and their answers to help you make informed decisions about your outdoor furniture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 1: What types of garden furniture are available?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Garden furniture comes in a wide variety of styles, materials, and designs. You can choose from classic wooden furniture, modern metal furniture, durable plastic furniture, or natural rattan furniture. Each material has its own unique advantages and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my space?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Consider the size and layout of your garden, as well as your personal style and needs. Measure the available space to ensure that the furniture fits comfortably without cluttering the area. Think about the activities you'll be doing in the garden, such as dining, lounging, or entertaining, and choose furniture that suits those purposes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 3: What are the best materials for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: The best materials for garden furniture depend on your needs and preferences. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal furniture is also durable and low-maintenance, but it can get hot in the sun. Plastic furniture is lightweight, affordable, and easy to clean, but it may not be as stylish as other materials. Rattan furniture is durable and weather-resistant, making it a good choice for outdoor use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 4: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Regular maintenance is essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come. Clean the furniture regularly with a mild detergent and water, and dry it thoroughly. If the furniture is made of wood, apply a sealant or oil to protect it from the elements. For metal furniture, use a rust-resistant spray to prevent rust. Store cushions and pillows indoors when not in use to protect them from rain and sun damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 5: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Whether you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the material and climate. Some materials, such as plastic and metal, are more resistant to harsh weather conditions than others, like wood. If you live in a climate with extreme temperatures or heavy rainfall, it's best to store your garden furniture indoors or cover it with protective covers during the off-season.</p>
<p><strong><em>Question 6: Where can I buy high-quality garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
Answer: Newtownards' furniture shops offer a wide range of high-quality garden furniture to suit different styles and budgets. Visit their showrooms to see the furniture in person and get expert advice from their knowledgeable staff.</p>
<p>With these questions answered, you're well on your way to choosing and caring for the perfect garden furniture for your outdoor space.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 2: Create a cohesive look:</strong><br />
