<p><strong>Tip 2: Prioritize comfort:</strong><br />
Garden furniture should be comfortable and inviting. Choose furniture with cushions and pillows made from weather-resistant fabrics. Consider adding an outdoor rug to define your seating area and provide a soft surface underfoot. You may also want to add a shade structure, such as a pergola or umbrella, to provide protection from the sun on hot days.</p>

Regularly clean and maintain your garden furniture to keep it looking its best and extend its lifespan. Wipe down your furniture with a mild detergent and water solution, and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. Apply protective sealants or stains to your furniture to help it resist moisture and UV damage. Store your furniture in a dry place during the off-season to protect it from the elements.</p>
