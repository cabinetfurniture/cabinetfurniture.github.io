<p>By protecting garden furniture from the elements, preservatives help to extend its lifespan and keep it looking its best.</p>
<h3>Prevents mold and mildew growth</h3>
<p>Mold and mildew are common problems for garden furniture, especially in humid or rainy climates. These unsightly growths can damage furniture and make it unsafe to use. Mold and mildew can also cause respiratory problems for some people.</p>
<p>Garden furniture preservatives contain fungicides that help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. These fungicides work by killing mold and mildew spores and preventing them from germinating. Preservatives also help to create a protective barrier on the surface of the furniture that makes it difficult for mold and mildew to grow.</p>
<p>In addition to using a preservative, there are a few other things you can do to prevent mold and mildew growth on your garden furniture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your furniture clean. Dirt and debris can provide a food source for mold and mildew.</li>
<li>Store your furniture in a dry place when it is not in use.</li>
<li>Avoid placing your furniture in areas that are constantly wet or humid.</li>
<li>If you do notice mold or mildew growth on your furniture, clean it immediately with a mild detergent and water. You can also use a commercial mold and mildew cleaner.</li>
