Do you need furniture that is comfortable for lounging or dining? Once you know what you need and want, you can start narrowing down your choices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tip 3: Measure Your Space</em></strong><br />
Before you buy any garden furniture, it is important to measure your space. This will help you to choose furniture that is the right size and scale for your area. You don't want to overcrowd your space or choose furniture that is too small.</p>

Outdoor rugs can define your space and add a touch of coziness. And if you have room, you can even add an outdoor sofa or lounge chair for ultimate relaxation.</p>
