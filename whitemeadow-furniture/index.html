Answer: The best materials for garden furniture depend on your specific needs and preferences. Some popular and durable options include teak, aluminum, wicker, and plastic.

Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture to ensure that it fits comfortably without overcrowding the space. Also, think about how you'll be using the furniture.
