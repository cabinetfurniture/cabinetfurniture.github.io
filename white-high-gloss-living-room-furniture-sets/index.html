<h3>Tips</h3>

<p><strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</strong> The material of your garden furniture will determine its durability, maintenance requirements, and overall appearance.

<p><strong>Tip 3: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong> The best way to protect your garden furniture from the elements is to cover it when not in use. You can use a tarp or a furniture cover to protect your furniture from rain, snow, and UV rays. If your furniture is made of wood, you should also treat it with a sealant to protect it from rot and decay.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Clean your furniture regularly.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best, you should clean it regularly with a mild soap and water solution. You can also use a pressure washer to clean your furniture, but be sure to use a low setting to avoid damaging the finish.</p>
<p>By following these tips, you can choose and care for your garden furniture to ensure that it lasts for many years to come.</p>
